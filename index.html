  <title>The Lovers' Conversation</title>
  
  <B>June</B>: <br><br>  

The title chosen for this blog is Lovers' Conversation. I think that the cliché of the phrase begs for a paragraph or two aimed at justifying the choice of the title, before we start our actual conversation in this space we are building. 
<br><br>
You (yes, yoy) would agree that there is a sensual dimension in the very act of conversation. We gaze at each other, peel off each other's sentences, savor their naked meaning, interlace our fleshy words, exchange our unspoken secret imaginations, and fuse our lascivious, lustrous, titillated ideas that long to infiltrate the other as much as to be consumed by the other, dancing to the rhythm of each other's unconscious breathing. It is love making. 
<br><br>
Through the state of inter-subjectivity formed by our conversation, we are able to touch ourselves and at the same time each other. A touch of the other that brings change in our being. Come deeper, come as yourself. Whether that change be an abrupt rupture or a gradual tinge, it is the change that weaves us together and brings forth our future.   
<br><br>
So the lovers' conversation is indeed what I envision to be taking place on this blog. hold me ever so loosely and ever so tightly. May our differences never fail to mesmerize each other and draw us closer in attraction. May our similarities continue to help us become the best comrade in pursuit of what is beautiful, true, and good. Cheers to all the colorful pixie dust that will be poured out by us here on this page.

Here is my first kiss to you, mon amour.<br>
당기세요, 미세요, 춤을 춥시다.

You know that I always tend, in every situation, to try to understand and unveil the structure 
of what happens, of what we say. That's probably, as a mathematician, a professional deformation. 
For me it is particularly exciting when it is complex and invisible, ungraspable but 
by glimpses, as a relationship with a lover, the world itself, or a hidden will 
that rules it all, a hidden love that makes it possible. 
Some may think that objectivisation of what we see by glimpses is somehow obscene, reducing 
an infinite beauty into human constructions, into mechanisms; but when seen in the right way, 
this objectivisation is the very unique way that we have, as humans, to get even closer to 
these mysteries. I think that for this reason and just as you, I am attracted to unveiling 
the conditions of possibility of a relation, of its very functioning. What are we and how, by 
the relation, our beings can be changed, one under the action of the other ? We interact, so we should exist as beings that make this relation possible. I'd say that if we are in relation 
with words, this means that there is in me something that is able to translate these words 
into a whole process of analysis, correspondance, analogy with all that I have lived and known, serve as a hypothetical answer to my superficial and sometimes deeper interogations, sometimes 
that I am not even conscious of, and by the very fact that these interrogations act as 
a code for my whole dynamical behavior, I might find myself, in the sense that myself is 
this coded existence, changed throught this process of relation. 
Furthermore, as I change under the action of the relation, that I am determined by it, I 
become more and more a part, as melted in it, of the being that gathers the two beings that 
are related. In a further extend, that's how we might return, after a long separation, to the wide womb that allowed our existence, the whole world itself.

Longing, Desire, and Names
  <br><br>
Carrying on with the theme of conversation and an ever so elusive nature of relation, I want to touch on and grapple with your last remarks (a well-posed, indeed titillating foreplay ;P): <i>"I'd say that if we are in relation with words, this means that there is in me 'something' that is able to translate these words into a whole process of analysis, correspondance, analogy with all that I lived and known, serve as a hypothetical answer to my superficial and sometimes deeper interogations, sometimes that I am not even conscious of, and by the very fact that these interrogations act as a code for my whole dynamical behavior, I might find myself, in the sense that myself is this 'coded existence,' changed throught this process of relation."</i> <br><br>
Here I will make an attempt at catching the glimpse of that "something" in our coded existence, by analyzing concept of longing and desire which I believe act as backbones of our mode of processing the world into our words. Longing and desire are fundamentally embedded in the act of naming the other/others/Other. With the act of naming, in that moment where the other is recognized, captured, or called by our words, the very chance of relation opens up. At the same time, a semantic space, a tragic chasm between "I" and "the other" is created by this very act. The given-ness of our being-in-the-world entangles us to faceless others and yet encapsulates us in solitude left with the unquenchable thirst to conenct and to escape the felt singularness of our being. The name, perhaps what we can call a prototype of language, stands in between these contradictions, fascinating. Anyways, I consider this a fitting undertaking since every grammar book I know begins with a chapter on nouns, and what we are doing now is looking into the grammar of our dynamical behaviors. <br><br>
Longing and desire, as that "something" in our otherwise static and passive mode of being (which really is not more than a composite collection of experiences from the past and imaginations for the future), serve as both the orientation and thrusting energy with which the dynamical behaviour of our coded existence acts on and retains/propagates itself in relation to the other. I think that the mechanisms of longing and desire function in opposite ways and with that said, there is a continuous interplay of the longing and desire in the way our whole being moves along our ontological coordinates in relation to the other.<br><br>
The phenomenon of longing occurs under the premise that the other "who is supposed to be" is absent here and now. Like lovers separated from each other, we call on the other's name with an aching heart, in hope of retaining ourselves by finding the missing other. But this act has an ill-fated resolution from the onset, for this name calling ends up accentuating the other's absence and distance from the one who calls even more to the point where it becomes unclear whether longing for the unknown/unseen/unheard has created the need for naming or the longing is created by the existence of the other's name itself. Thus we finally find ourselves alone with our words; for the first time we are truly alone with language, abandoned without any final foundation. Calling the other with the name becomes a dubious and hopeless project, which then transforms into nostalgia and melancholia, revoking a primordial emptiness in our being.<br><br>
The phenomenon of desire, on the other hand, functions with the principle of pleasure, self-expansion, hypertelia, the pure being-for-itself open towards multiplicies of others. The act of naming driven by desire differs from that of longing in the sense that the projection of desire renders the act of naming as a means for an epistemological possession of the other. Definitions and objectifications and dominations, tendencies fraught with political bearings. Under this logic, the image of Adam giving names to all livestock and to the birds of the heavens and to every beast of the field becomes that of a colonizer rather than a lover, faithfully following the command “Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth and subdue it, and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over every living thing that moves on the earth!”<br><br>
Whether conscious or unconscious, the longing and desire that reside within (I dare not say above) our coded existence proffer actions that navigate the trajectory of our future experiences, which also, through our language and with time, be processed, narrated, and internalized, to become the codes that dictate our next moves. Repeat. Cycle. Confinement. difficult questions arise: Can freedom of human will be demonstrated from self-consciousness? What are the interaction between language and (un)consciousness, time and (un)consciousness?<br><br> 
I turn these questions to yoy, mon Silvère.<br>
Gros bisous, Your June <br> <br> <br> <br>
  
  <b>Silvère</b>: <br><br>
  
As I understand it, your analysis is leading to an identification of a primary (in the sense that it is a part of a development) mode of our dynamics towards primary words that are names. Naming 
  is fulfilling our natural tendency towards possession and control, not in the sense of possession of the object itself, but the possession of the representation, 
  the possession of the access to information, and knowledge of the represented object. The will halts the exploration after the feeling of this possession, but this is 
  only a first step in the development of our being. I think that the nature of the command of God to Adam has to be thought carefully; we could 
  think about it as an imperative of the development, a momentary fatality and not a 'you should do' that would apply at all time. The desire of repetition of 
  this possession feeling indentifies an accessible object that underlies this not yet understood phenomenon of controled information access. 
  Progressively the word itself becomes a part of a collection. <br> <br> 
  
  Another step of the development leads to an hypertelic projection of various feelings onto the names (fear, or desire), phenomena underlying 
  the concept of ghost (the dead is present in our thought through the development of a residual fear which expands itself due to 
  the absence of counter information that would come from the dead himself). The similar projection of desire is more likely 
  to lead to awareness of this phenomenon, as we can observe it in the shift that results between the projected desire 
  onto the name and the latent desire towards the object itself. This awareness becomes the very possibility an actual developement of
  knowledge, as the desire to fill the gap between the representation and the object. Naturally this exploration movement leads 
  itself to the feeling of confinement, as there is often no way easily accessible way to know more. In order to overcome this obstacle, 
  we are attracted to that which becomes the privileged direction of our thoughts, localised infinite others, spaces for freedom, 
  whose names are many doors towards infinity. <br> <br> 
  
  To answer your first question, I would say that freedom might exist or not exist, according to the conception that 
  we have of this concept. We often observe will-for-freedom, but not freedom itself - which could be a byproduct of 
  the mental expression of will-for-freedom. The freedom of the will-for-freedom is the sensation of the more abstract 
  version of this concept. More precisely, it is the sensation of the possibility to choose. In order to measure 
  this possibility, I could represent myself the quantity of choices that are coherent with my past obersvations. 
  However, given that we are, altough complex, mechanical beings determined by laws of nature, what do we exactly choose ? 
  I would answer that when we say we choose, we report the self-representation of that 
the state of the world and the current action that we take are un-corelated to our knowledged, interpreted as an 'out-of-nowhere'
decision. <br> <br> 

I'll also answer you with another question: there are two primary modes of reacting to names, one towards the past (longing) 
and the other towards the future (desire). How do we come to the necessity to live in the present (according to 
some movements of thought) and how to we actually do it ? <br><br><br><br>

Sorry about my long hiatus after your response. And I thank yoy for your patience. I had a difficult time forming into words this scheme I had in mind:<p><br>
  <img style="padding: 0 15px; float: left;" "image-orientation: 270deg;" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junesilvere/junesilvere.github.io/master/Desire%20and%20Longing%20Scheme.jpg" alt="this is an image of love" class="rotate270" width="50%" height="50%"/>
<p><br>So after dealing with the nouns, it is now turn to think about verbs: tenses, active voice vs passive voice, and prepositions. 
In my opinion, Longing and Desire, although it is often the case, are not necessarily each tied to the past and the future; rather, they are associated with two opposing modes of conceiving the world--one is eschatological and the other creational. The eschatological presses down on us whereas the creational swells us into the state near bursting. If one thinks of the future as the impending End, the one that is "missing" here and now, longing can be directed towards the future as well (but the future in this sense is the past, because it is a closed ending that one has identified as an object). Likewise, desire can be for the past, if the desire entails re-creating the past, through acts such as forgiveness or unearthing forgotten memories. This way, the past becomes an opening towards new potentialities. Our balancing act then is not between the past and the future, but it between the closedness and the openness of the universe, our deductive and inductive approaches towards the unknown, so to speak. This tension is wedded into the fabric of our being, with individual variations on the spectrum between the two dialectic poles. Our freedom does not lie in either side of the poles but exists in the oscillating movement between the two poles. Our lives are interlaced with willed actions (active/made) and limits in our abilities (passive/given) as well as acceptance of and defiance against the predetermined grand narrative. Our ontological freedom, likewise, is within the liminal space of the boundary in-between, in the state of being-with. Perhaps the place of freedom is our skin, in feeling one's naked body against the blowing wind. Perhaps it is in our words, in our pauses between words that contain the other's silence. Perhaps freedom is an attribute of love.

  P.S. I have yet to respond to your thought provoking remarks about our emotive projection towards representations, especially towards the representation of objects that we cannot possess cognitively. Feelings can pass through, in and out, between the solid boundaries I mentioned above. Let's talk about the diffusive nature of feelings more.
