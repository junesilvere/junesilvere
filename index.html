  <title>The Lovers' Conversation</title>
  
  <B>June</B>: <br><br>  

The title chosen for this blog is Lovers' Conversation. I think that the cliché of the phrase begs for a paragraph or two aimed at justifying the choice of the title, before we start our actual conversation in this space we are building. 
<br><br>
You (yes, yoy) would agree that there is a sensual dimension in the very act of conversation. We gaze at each other, peel off each other's sentences, savor their naked meaning, interlace our fleshy words, exchange our unspoken secret imaginations, and fuse our lascivious, lustrous, titillated ideas that long to infiltrate the other as much as to be consumed by the other, dancing to the rhythm of each other's unconscious breathing. It is love making. 
<br><br>
Through the state of inter-subjectivity formed by our conversation, we are able to touch ourselves and at the same time each other. A touch of the other that brings change in our being. Come deeper, come as yourself. Whether that change be an abrupt rupture or a gradual tinge, it is the change that weaves us together and brings forth our future.   
<br><br>
So the lovers' conversation is indeed what I envision to be taking place on this blog. hold me ever so loosely and ever so tightly. May our differences never fail to mesmerize each other and draw us closer in attraction. May our similarities continue to help us become the best comrade in pursuit of what is beautiful, true, and good. Cheers to all the colorful pixie dust that will be poured out by us here on this page.

Here is my first kiss to you, mon amour.<br>
당기세요, 미세요, 춤을 춥시다.

You know that I always tend, in every situation, to understand and unveil the structure 
of what happens, of what we say. That's probably, as a mathematician, a professional deformation. 
For me it is particularly exciting when it is complex and invisible, ungraspable but 
by glimpses, as a relationship with a lover, the world itself, or a hidden will 
that rule it all, a hidden love that makes it possible. 
Some may think that objectivication of what we see by glimpses is somehow obscene, reducing 
an infinite beauty into human constructions, into mecanisms; but when seen in the right way, 
this objectivisation is the very unique way that we have, as humans, to get even closer to 
these mysteries. I think that for this reason and just as you, I am attracted to unveiling 
the conditions of possibility of a relation, of its very functioning. What are we and how, by 
the relation, our beings can be changed, one under the action of the other ? We interact, so we should exist as beings that make this relation possible. I'd say that if we are in relation 
with words, this means that there is in me something that is able to translate these words 
into a whole process of analysis, correspondance, analogy with all that I lived and known, serve as a hypothetical answer to my superficial and sometimes deeper interogations, sometimes 
that I am not even conscious of, and by the very fact that these interrogations act as 
a code for my whole dynamical behavior, I might find myself, in the sense that myself is 
this coded existence, changed throught this process of relation. 
Furthermore, as I change under the action of the relation, that I am determined by it, I 
become more and more a part, as melted in it, of the being that gathers the two beings that 
are related. In a further extend, that's how we might return, after a long separation, to the wide woumb that allowed our existence, the whole world itself.
