  <title>The Lovers' Conversation</title>

The title chosen for this blog is Lovers' Conversation. I think that the cliché of the phrase begs for a paragraph or two aimed at justifying the choice of the title, before we start our actual conversation in this space we are building. 
<br><br>
You (yes, yoy) would agree that there is a sensual dimension in the very act of conversation. We gaze at each other, peel off each other's sentences, savor their naked meaning, interlace our fleshy words, exchange our unspoken secret imaginations, and fuse our lascivious, lustrous, titillated ideas that long to infiltrate the other as much as to be consumed by the other, dancing to the rhythm of each other's unconscious breathing. It is love making. 
<br><br>
Through the state of inter-subjectivity formed by our conversation, we are able to touch ourselves and at the same time each other. A touch of the other that brings change in our being. Come deeper, come as yourself. Whether that change be an abrupt rupture or a gradual tinge, it is the change that weaves us together and brings forth our future.   
<br><br>
So the lovers' conversation is indeed what I envision to be taking place on this blog. hold me ever so loosely and ever so tightly. May our differences never fail to mesmerize each other and draw us closer in attraction. May our similarities continue to help us become the best comrade in pursuit of what is beautiful, true, and good. Cheers to all the colorful pixie dust that will be poured out by us here on this page.

Here is my first kiss to you, mon amour.<br>
당기세요, 미세요, 춤을 춥시다.
